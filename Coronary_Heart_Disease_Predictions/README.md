## 📌 Overview

The project focused on developing a **logistic regression model**
to predict the likelihood of **coronary heart disease** (CHD).
Given a dataset with **over 300 features**, the challenge was to
effectively pre-process the data and implement the model without
relying on standard machine learning libraries.

The workflow included:

- **Data Pre-processing:** Cleaning the dataset, handling missing
values, and applying feature selection to retain only the most 
relevant predictors.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying key medical indicators and
reducing dimensionality to improve model performance.
- **Logistic Regression Implementation:** Writing the entire 
model from scratch, including the cost function, gradient descent
optimization, and decision threshold for classification.
