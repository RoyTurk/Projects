# Finite Element Modelling and Simulation - Structural Analysis of the EPFL Logo 🏗️

- **Category:** FEM
- **Course:** Finite Element Modelling and Simulation (ME-373)
- **Date:** Spring 2024
- **Language:** French

---

## 📌 Overview

This project involved performing **Finite Element Analysis** (FEA)
on the "F" in the **EPFL logo** to study its structural behavior
under different loading conditions, including **buckling stability
analysis**.

The project involved:

- **Geometry Construction:** Creating a precise representation of
"F" shape for simulation.
- **Mesh Generation & Convergence Study:** Refining the mesh to
ensure accurate results while balancing computational efficient.
- **Structural Analysis:** Evaluating stress distribution, 
deformation, and failure risks under various loading conditions.
- **Buckling Analysis:** Assessing the critical load at which 
instability occurs.
