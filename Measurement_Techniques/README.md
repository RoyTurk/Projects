## Overview

The objective of this project was to **design an experiment** and measure 
three different physical quantities using distinct sensing mechanisms.
Our team chose to study the **deflection of thin plates submerged in
water**, analyzing the forces acting on them and their response under flow
conditions. 

The experiment involved:

- **Force Measurement:** Using a load cell to measure the forces exerted on
the plate, with data acquisition handled via Arduino.
- **Deflection Analysis:** Capturing the plate's deformation using a camera
and processing images for displacement tracking.
- **Flow Velocity Measurement:** Implementing Particle Image Velocimetry
  (PIV) to analyze the velocity field around the plate.

## Tools Used

- **Software:** Arduino IDE, PIVLab, GIMP
- **Documentation:** Latex
