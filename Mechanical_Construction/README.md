# Mechanical Construction - Carrot Peeler Design

- **Category:** Mechanical Design / CAD
- **Course:** Mechanical Construction II (ME-102)
- **Date:** Spring 2022
- **Language:** French

### Overview

This project was my **first major semester project at EPFL**, offering an 
opportunity to apply creativity and implement key concepts learned in my
courses. The objective was to design a **carrot peeler** that met specific
mechanical and functional requirements.

The project involved:

- **Designing and analysing** the machine, ensuring proper functionality
and efficiency.
- **Creating 3D models** using CATIA and producing detailed **2D technical
drawings**.
- **Selecting appropriate components**, such as screws and springs, from 
manufacturer catalogs.
- **Choosing suitable materials** based on mechanical properties and
manufacturing constraints.

### Tools used

- **Software**: CATIA V5
- **Documentation**: Latex
