## 📌 Overview

This project aimed to investigate the **ground effect** on the **aerodynamic
coefficients** of an airfoil, enhancing understanding of how proximity to
the ground influences lift and drag. 

The study involved:

- **Geometry Construction:** Creating the airfoil model to accurately 
represent real-world conditions.
- **Mesh Generation & Convergence Analysis:** Creating multiple
computational meshes and performing convergence studies to ensure reliable
results.
- **Ground Effect Analysis:** Varying height-to-chord ratio to evaluate its
impact on aerodynamic performance, focusing in lift and drag coefficients.
