# Projects

## üìå Introduction

Welcome to my **project archive**! A collection of diverse works that reflect my interests, coding style, documentation approach, and work methodology. This repository serves two key purposes:

- **Showcase:** To provide an overview of the skills and experience I have developed across differents fields.
- **Personal Archive:* A reference for myself to revisit past projects, track progress, and build upon previous work.

The projects span across computational engineering, machine learning, numerical simulations, robotics, CAD, CFD, and more. 

I also hope this repository sparks engaging discussions, whether it's about problem-solving approaches, technical details, or collaborative ideas!

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository represents a separate project and follows a standardized format for clarity and consistency.

- *`Project_Name/`* - Each project has its own dedicated directory.
- *`README.md`* - Provides an overview of the project, including:
  - Category (e.g. CFD, Coding, Mechanical Design)
  - Tools Used (e.g. Programming Language, Software)
  - Project Goals
- Implementation Details
  - *`X_Final_Report.pdf`* - A detailed document that explains the methodology, analysis and results of the project.
  - **Project Files** - Source code, CAD models, simulation files, or datasets used in the project.

## üí° Notes

- Some projects may be **closed-source** due to institutional constraints.
- While this repository aims to **document and archive** my work, continuous imporvements are always welcome!

## üîç Future Additions

I plan to expand this repository with upcoming projects, including Turbulence Modelling, High-Performance Computing, and CFD for hemodynamics. Stay tuned for updates!
