## Overview

This project was conducted at [MICROBS Laboratory]() as part of my
**final major Bachelor's project**, marking the conclusion of my 
first three years at EPFL as a **Mechanical Engineering student**.
The goal was to enhance the precision of a **robotic surgeon** 
performing microsurgery on zebra-fish embryos by developing an
**image registration system** for accurate alignment. The news 
article can be found [here]().

The workflow included:

- **Researching Similarity Metrics:** Studied and implemented
different techniques for image alignment, including
  - Person Correlation Coefficient (measuring linear similarity)
  - Mutual Information (capturing statistical dependence)
  - Structural Similarity Index (preserving perceptual quality)

Due to the **closed-source** nature of this project, I am unable
to share specific details, implementations, or results. However,
this experience provided valuable insight into computer vision,
medical image processing, and optimization techniques.

## Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Software:** MATLAB
- **Documentation:** Latex
