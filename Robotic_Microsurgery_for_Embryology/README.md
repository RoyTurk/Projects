## 📌 Overview

This project was conducted at [MICROBS Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/microbs/) as part of my
**final major Bachelor's project**, marking the conclusion of my 
first three years at EPFL as a **Mechanical Engineering student**.
The goal was to enhance the precision of a **robotic surgeon** 
performing microsurgery on zebra-fish embryos by developing an
**image registration system** for accurate alignment. The news 
article can be found [here](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/a-robotic-microsurgeon-reveals-how-embryos-grow/).

The workflow included:

- **Researching Similarity Metrics:** Studied and implemented
different techniques for image alignment, including
  - Person Correlation Coefficient (measuring linear similarity)
  - Mutual Information (capturing statistical dependence)
  - Structural Similarity Index (preserving perceptual quality)

Due to the **closed-source** nature of this project, I am unable
to share specific details, implementations, or results. However,
this experience provided valuable insight into computer vision,
medical image processing, and optimization techniques.
