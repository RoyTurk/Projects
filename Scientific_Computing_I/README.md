## Scientific Computing I - Carom's Billiard Game 🎱

- **Category:** Coding
- **Course:** Programming for Engineers (ME-213)
- **Date:** Spring 2023
- **Language:** English

---

### 📌 Overview 

This was my **first large-scale coding project**, building on previous 
programming courses by integrating **three different languages** into a
unified system. The goal was to analyze a **Carom Billiard game** using 
frame-by-frame video processing, plot the results, and determine the game 
outcome.

- **C:** Extracted ball positions from the video sequences.
- **MATLAB:** Processed and plotted the data to check if the game was won.
- **LabVIEW:** Acted as a *chef d'orchestre*, ensuring smooth data flow
between C and MATLAB, along with error management.

### 📂 Project Structure 

- [Generated_Sequences](Generated_Sequences) contains the generated PDFs of all the sequences
provided in the course.
- [Source](Source) includes all source code files written in C, MATLAB, LabVIEW.
The main execution file is *`Billard2023.vi`*.
- [ME213_Report.pdf](ME213_Report.pdf) details the code structure, function explanations,
and overall methodology used in the analysis.
