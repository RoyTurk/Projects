## Overview

This project focused on **predicting tweet sentiments** (positive
or negative) using both traditional machine learning methods and
advanced transformer models. Given the noisy and informal nature
of tweets, the challenge was to develop models that could
effectively handle short text, slang, and varying writing styles.

The workflow included:

- **Baseline Models:** Implemented traditional machine learning 
approaches such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines
to establish initial performance benchmarks.
- **Advanced Models:** Leveraged BERT and BERTweet, fine-tuning
these deep learning models to better understand contextual nuances
in tweets.
- **Performance Optimization:** Compared accuracy and F1 scores
across different models to quantify improvements.
